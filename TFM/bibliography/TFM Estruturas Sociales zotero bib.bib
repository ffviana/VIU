            The success of an on-line movement could be defined in terms of the shift to large-scale and the later off-line massive street actions of protests. The role of social media in this process is to facilitate the transformation from small or local feelings of disagreement into large-scale social actions. The way how social media achieves that effect is by growing clusters of people and groups with similar effervescent feelings, which otherwise would not be in touch with each other. It is natural to think that these kinds of macro social actions, as a consequence of the spontaneous and massive interactions, will attain the growth and divergence of those clusters, like the correlation length of statistical physics, giving rise to important simplifications on several statistics. In this work, we report the presence of signs of criticality in social demonstrations. Namely, similar power-law exponents are found whenever the distributions are calculated either considering time windows of the same length or with the same number of hashtag usages. In particular, the exponents for the distributions during the event were found to be smaller than before the event, and this is also observed either if we count the hashtags only once per user or if all their usages are considered. By means of network representations, we show that the systems present two kinds of high connectedness, characterised by either high or low values of modularity. The importance of analysing systems near a critical point is that any small disturbance can escalate and induce large-scale—nationwide—chain reactions.},

	abstract = {The study of networks, including computer networks, social networks, and biological networks, has attracted enormous interest in recent years. The rise of the Internet and the wide availability of inexpensive computers have made it possible to gather and analyse network data on an unprecendented scale, and the development of new theoretical tools has allowed us to extract knowledge from networks of many different kinds. The study of networks is broadly interdisciplinary and developments have occurred in many fields, including mathematics, physics, computer and information sciences, biology, and the social science. This book brings together the most important breakthroughts in each of these fields and presents them in a unified fashion, highlighting the strong interconnections between work in different areas. Topics covered include the measurement of networks; methods for analysing network data, including methods developed in physics, statistics, and sociology; fundamentals of graph theory; computer algorithms, including spectral algorithms and community detection; mathematical models of networks such as random graph models and generative models; and models of processes taking place on networks.},

	abstract = {This essay is an analysis of the success of the mid-20th century civil rights movement in the United States. The civil rights movement was a seminal event in American history and resulted in several legislative victories, including the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and the 1965 Voting Rights Act. After a brief overview of segregation and Jim Crow la3ws in the southern U.S., I will argue that the success of the civil rights movement can be attributed to a combination of factors. One of these factors was the effective strategy of nonviolent protests, in which the American public witnessed the contrasting actions of peaceful protestors and violent local authorities. In addition, political opportunities also played a role in the movement’s success, as during the Cold War the U.S. federal government became increasingly concerned about their international image. Other reasons for the movement’s success include an increased access to television among the American public, and pre-existing black institutions and organizations. The civil rights movement left an important legacy and ensuing social movements have utilized similar framing techniques and strategies.},

These connections are indicators of content sharing, and network structures reflect patterns of information flow. This article proposes a conceptual and practical model for the classification of topical Twitter networks, based on their network-level structures. As current literature focuses on the classification of users to key positions, this study utilizes the overall network structures in order to classify Twitter conversation based on their patterns of information flow. Four network-level metrics, which have established as indicators of information flow characteristics—density, modularity, centralization, and the fraction of isolated users—are utilized in a three-step classification model. This process led us to suggest six structures of information flow: divided, unified, fragmented, clustered, in and out hub-and-spoke networks. We demonstrate the value of these network structures by segmenting 60 Twitter topical social media network datasets into these six distinct patterns of collective connections, illustrating how different topics of conversations exhibit different patterns of information flow. We discuss conceptual and practical implications for each structure.},

Thus temporal variations in interaction networks are deeply impacted by the temporal dimension of human activity. In this paper, we address this issue through a detailed analysis on the retweets and comments of 550,000 Twitter users. We propose a temporal network model to represent the interaction network on Twitter, in which each node contains an activity window and the emergence of the edges between nodes are dependent on it. Speci cally, the activity window is de ned as the backtracking length from the message ow posted by the user’s friend, which represents the user’s social ability. It complies with a power-law distribution with an exponential cut-o . The interaction network is sparser and more clustered than the followee-follower network, in which the interaction stability and burstiness uctuate with the activity window or with the degree to which the two users are involved in the communication. Finally, the e ect of activity window on the aggregating degrees of the interaction network is examined.},

	abstract = {In recent decades, different social innovations – such as lifelong learning, inclusion or Education for Sustainable Development – have had a huge impact on domestic education systems. In an increasingly globalized world, innovations diffuse across national borders. At the same time, diffusion processes seem to be highly inﬂuenced by public and private actors, e.g., international organizations ({IOs}) or non-governmental organizations ({NGOs}). Both state and non-state actors use social networks and digital communication platforms, such as Twitter, as channels for the diffusion of social innovations and practices. Inclusive education, which has become the main alternative to special schools for the schooling of children with disabilities, is a widely discussed innovation in education and, hence, represents a suitable case for the study of global diffusion processes and the involved actors. Thus, drawing on social network theory ({SNT}), the aim of this paper is to examine the structure of the Twitter communication network forming around the social innovation of inclusive education. Empirically, we use social network analysis ({SNA}) to map the communication network; identify central actors; and infer assumptions about the role of different actor groups. Our results show, for instance, that especially {NGOs} and {IOs} hold central positions in the network, which enables them to exert inﬂuence on the diffusion of innovative ideas. Overall, the ﬁndings of our study indicate how the online communication tool Twitter can play a crucial role for actors who seek to inﬂuence the global diffusion of social innovations in education and effect education policies, norms and systems at the global, national and regional levels as such.},

This study theorizes Clubhouse as an emerging social media platform during the {COVID} pandemic, and empirically investigates its communicative capacity, networked connections, and social dynamics. The primary contribution is a social network analysis of Clubhouse’s early users, wherein segmented networked publics based on invite links emerge. While some researchers explain that the growth of invite-only social networks is often attributed to a platform’s ‘cool factor,’ the growth of the early Clubhouse network reveals a hierarchy of social exclusivity among the networked publics, which indicates an embedded capitalist social structure and connection that grants more access to those with more social and economic power. These networked relationships provide insights into how invite-based emerging viral social media platforms are formed.},

The paper also explores deﬁnitions of social/environmental movements. Whilst broadly agreeing with Diani’s consensual deﬁnition of a social movement, it argues that we need to be much more precise about the type and intensity of networking required; it must be more than informal or cursory, and should bind individuals and organizations into collaborative networks. Evidence from a survey of 149 environmental organizations and qualitative interviews with key campaigners suggests that whilst many organizations might share information, it is often stockpiled or ignored, hardly creating the kinds of network links that might lead to shared movement identity. The kinds of links that do bind movements are collaborative. In practice, in the environmental movement in London, conservationists tend neither to share information nor to engage in the collective action events of reformist or radical organizations, suggesting that conservationists should perhaps not be considered part of the movement.},

The Kalibakar peasant movement took place since the post-Japanese occupation, and to this day, the movement has not been finished. The Kalibakar peasant movement's main objective is the reclaiming of former {PTPN} {XII} plantation land of Kalibakar covering ± 2,050 Ha, which is believed by farmers as the land of his ancestors. At present, de facto, more than 95\% of the former plantation areas have been controlled by farmers. However, de jure, there is no evidence of farmers' ownership over the land because the government is still considered it in the status of the dispute. The Kalibakar peasant movement is fluctuating, sometimes ups and downs. One of the factors that influence it is the absence of social networks that support the peasant movement. This case study aims to describe the dynamics of the social exchange network. The results showed that the Kalibakar peasant movement did not occur entirely in social exchange because what happened was a network of opportunity-taking or a network of opportunity-seeking. So, in the movement arena, there were no more scarce resources that could be contested, and the peasant movement became stagnant.},

	abstract = {The United Kingdom has been generally identified as a leader in the development of anti-racist legislation. Specific anti-racist legislation was first introduced in the 1960s, and developed further in the 1970s, following on from the large-scale post-war immigration from the Commonwealth which led to a large-scale non-white presence in the United Kingdom for the first time. Thus in response to the domestic social and political effects of this migration, the United Kingdom witnessed the development of anti-racist movements and of advanced legislation against racial discrimination at a much earlier stage than in most other European states. As well as tackling direct and indirect forms of discrimination, many anti-racist associations in the United Kingdom have been motivated by the need to confront directly movements of the extreme right or to tackle outbreaks in racist violence. However, political and cultural divisions persist within the national movement.},
