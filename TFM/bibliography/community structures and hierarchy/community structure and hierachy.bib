	abstract = {The movement to free Al Jazeera journalists (\#{FreeAJStaff}), imprisoned by Egyptian authorities, utilized social media over almost 2 years, between 2013 and 2015. \#{FreeAJStaff} movement emerged as a unique blend of social movement and news media, taking place primarily on Twitter. This study applied a social networks approach to examine patterns of information flow within the \#{FreeAJStaff} movement on Twitter: the emergence of information siloes and social mediators, who bridge them. Twitter data of 22 months were collected, resulting in social networks created by 71,326 users who included the hashtag \#{FreeAJStaff} in their tweets, and 149,650 social ties (mentions and replies) among them. Analysis found social mediators to be primarily core movement actors (e.g., Al Jazeera) or elites (e.g., politicians), rather than grassroots actors. Furthermore, core actors exhibited more reciprocal relationship with other users than elite actors. In contrast, elite actors evoked denser exchange of messages. Finally, this study identified the mechanism used to create a Spillover Effect between social movements (such as \#{FreeAJStaff} and \#{FreeShawkan}), finding that mediated content, which travels across clusters, was more likely to include non-{FreeAJStaff} movement hashtags, than siloed content, which remains within a cluster. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

	abstract = {Social networks exhibit scaling laws for several structural characteristics, such as degree distribution, scaling of the attachment kernel and clustering coefﬁcients as a function of node degree. A detailed understanding if and how these scaling laws are inter-related is missing so far, let alone whether they can be understood through a common, dynamical principle. We propose a simple model for stationary network formation and show that the three mentioned scaling relations follow as natural consequences of triadic closure. The validity of the model is tested on multiplex data from a well-studied massive multiplayer online game. We ﬁnd that the three scaling exponents observed in the multiplex data for the friendship, communication and trading networks can simultaneously be explained by the model. These results suggest that triadic closure could be identiﬁed as one of the fundamental dynamical principles in social multiplex network formation.},

	abstract = {The k-core decomposition in a graph is a fundamental problem for social network analysis. The problem of k-core decomposition is to calculate the core number for every node in a graph. Previous studies mainly focus on k-core decomposition in a static graph. There exists a linear time algorithm for k-core decomposition in a static graph. However, in many real-world applications such as online social networks and the Internet, the graph typically evolves over time. In such applications, a key issue is to maintain the core numbers of nodes when the graph changes over time. A simple implementation is to perform the linear time algorithm to recompute the core number for every node after the graph is updated. Such simple implementation is expensive when the graph is very large. In this paper, we propose a new efﬁcient algorithm to maintain the core number for every node in a dynamic graph. Our main result is that only certain nodes need to update their core numbers when the graph is changed by inserting/deleting an edge. We devise an efﬁcient algorithm to identify and recompute the core numbers of such nodes. The complexity of our algorithm is independent of the graph size. In addition, to further accelerate the algorithm, we develop two pruning strategies by exploiting the lower and upper bounds of the core number. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments over both real-world and synthetic datasets, and the results demonstrate the efﬁciency of the proposed algorithm.},

At their core, social movements advance when people act collectively by rising in solidarity with a shared purpose to address injustice and inequality. Drawing on insights from consumer psychology, this review investigates how social movements succeed in creating social change. We build on an established 21st century framework for how social movements succeed to outline the promising practices of successful social movements. For each of these practices, we identify the consumer psychology mechanisms that motivate collective action and encourage people to transform from bystanders to upstanders, those who provide the grassroots momentum for successful social movements. We illustrate this framework with examples from the growth of the Black Lives Matter movement. Finally, we highlight insights from consumer psychology that promote an understanding of social movements, and we raise research questions to encourage more consumer psychologists to investigate how social movements succeed.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the problem of k-core has attracted wide-spread research attention due to the popularity of the graph-related applications, such as social network analysis, community detection, and collaboration networks. To efﬁciently support group-based activity planning, the organizers need to guarantee the size and closeness of the group. Current applications of the k-core only support searching for the maximum k-core group or adding the minimum number of edges to obtain the k-core. However, no research has focused on the problem of enlarging the k-core. In reality, when new tasks arrive, a work team needs to not only recruit new team members based on the requirements but also guarantee sufﬁcient closeness among the members for good cooperation. In this paper, we ﬁrst formalize a new query, a social group enlarging query with size constraints ({SGEQ}), which aims to ﬁnd n users to enlarge a subgraph from a k-core of size m to a (k + )-core of size (m+n) by inserting the minimum number of edges. We prove that the {SGEQ} problem is {NP}-hard. To solve this problem, we ﬁrst propose a novel algorithm, namely, the maximum connection edges algorithm ({MCEA}), which searches for the inserted vertex that has the most edges with an induced subgraph every time. Then, we develop an optimizing algorithm, namely, the maximum contribution degree algorithm ({MCDA}), which on average adds a number of edges in the expanded query less than that obtained by the {MCEA}. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate the efﬁciency of the proposed algorithms.},

	abstract = {Social networks exhibit a very special property: community structure. Understanding the network community structure is of great advantages. It not only provides helpful information in developing more social-aware strategies for social network problems but also promises a wide range of applications enabled by mobile networking, such as routings in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks ({MANETs}) and worm containments in cellular networks. Unfortunately, understanding this structure is very challenging, especially in dynamic social networks where social activities and interactions are evolving rapidly. Can we quickly and efﬁciently identify the network community structure? Can we adaptively update the network structure based on previously known information instead of recomputing from scratch? In this paper, we present Quick Community Adaptation ({QCA}), an adaptive modularity-based method for identifying and tracing community structure of dynamic online social networks. Our approach has not only the power of quickly and efﬁciently updating network communities, through a series of changes, by only using the structures identiﬁed from previous network snapshots, but also the ability of tracing the evolution of community structure over time. To illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithm, we extensively test {QCA} on real-world dynamic social networks including {ENRON} email network, {arXiv} e-print citation network and Facebook network. Finally, we demonstrate the bright applicability of our algorithm via a realistic application on routing strategies in {MANETs}. The comparative results reveal that social-aware routing strategies employing {QCA} as a community detection core outperform current available methods. I. {INTRODUCTION} Many social networks exhibit the property of containing community structure [1][2], i.e., they naturally divide into groups of vertices with denser connections inside each group and fewer connections crossing groups, where vertices and connections represent network users and their social interactions, respectively. Members in each community of a social network usually share things in common such as interests in photography, movies, music or discussion topics and thus, they tend to interact more frequently with each other than with members outside of their community. Community detection in a network is the gathering of network vertices into groups in such a way that nodes in each group are densely connected inside and sparser outside.},
