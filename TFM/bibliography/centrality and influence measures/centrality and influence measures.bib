	abstract = {Whilst being hailed as the remedy to the world’s ills, cities will need to adapt in the 21st century. In particular, the role of public transport is likely to increase significantly, and new methods and technics to better plan transit systems are in dire need. This paper examines one fundamental aspect of transit: network centrality. By applying the notion of betweenness centrality to 28 worldwide metro systems, the main goal of this paper is to study the emergence of global trends in the evolution of centrality with network size and examine several individual systems in more detail. Betweenness was notably found to consistently become more evenly distributed with size (i.e. no ‘‘winner takes all’’) unlike other complex network properties. Two distinct regimes were also observed that are representative of their structure. Moreover, the share of betweenness was found to decrease in a power law with size (with exponent 1 for the average node), but the share of most central nodes decreases much slower than least central nodes (0.87 vs. 2.48). Finally the betweenness of individual stations in several systems were examined, which can be useful to locate stations where passengers can be redistributed to relieve pressure from overcrowded stations. Overall, this study offers significant insights that can help planners in their task to design the systems of tomorrow, and similar undertakings can easily be imagined to other urban infrastructure systems (e.g., electricity grid, water/wastewater system, etc.) to develop more sustainable cities.},

We represent a dataset of published papers in the Public Library of Science ({PLOS}) via a cocitation network and compute three established centrality metrics for each paper in the network: closeness, betweenness, and eigenvector. Our results show that the network of papers in a journal is scale-free and that eigenvector centrality (1) is an effective ﬁlter and article-level metric and (2) correlates well with citation counts within a given journal. However, closeness centrality is a poor ﬁlter because articles ﬁt within a small range of citations. We also show that betweenness centrality is a poor ﬁlter for journals with a narrow focus and a good ﬁlter for multidisciplinary journals where communities of papers can be identiﬁed.},

We calculate the distribution of control centrality for several real networks and find that it is mainly determined by the network’s degree distribution. We show that in a directed network without loops the control centrality of a node is uniquely determined by its layer index or topological position in the underlying hierarchical structure of the network. Inspired by the deep relation between control centrality and hierarchical structure in a general directed network, we design an efficient attack strategy against the controllability of malicious networks.},

However, the importance of bridging nodes has often been ignored in previous studies, which have instead focused on hub nodes. Here, we propose a novel approach named Bridging Node Centrality ({BNC}) to identify bridging nodes. {BNC} is a method based on different levels of network paths, and it combines trafﬁc ﬂow and positional properties of nodes, which greatly diminishes the effect of node degree. The performance of {BNC} was tested in many synthetic and real-world networks including {LFR} benchmark networks, social networks, biological networks, collaboration networks, etc. By comparing with other methods, and the results indicated that whether based on accuracy or approximate accuracy, {BNC} could be accurate and robust all the time in different types of complex networks.},

The tracking of single community in social networks is commonly done using some of the centrality measures employed in social network community tracking. The ability that centrality measures have to determine the relative position of a node within a network has been used in previous research work to track communities in social networks using betweenness, closeness and degree centrality measures. It introduces a new metric K-path centrality, and a randomized algorithm for estimating it, and shows empirically that nodes with high K-path centrality have high node betweenness centrality.},

	abstract = {Online social networks are widely used platforms that enable people to connect with each other. These social media channels provide an active communication platform for people, and they have opened new venues of research for the academic world and business. One of these research areas is measuring the inﬂuential users in online social networks; and the same is true for academic networks where ﬁnding inﬂuential authors is an area of interest. In an academic network, citation count, h-index and their variations are used to ﬁnd top authors. In this article, we propose the adoption of established social network measures, including centrality and prestige, in an academic network to compute the rank of authors. For the empirical analysis, the widely-used dataset of the Digital Bibliography and Library Project ({DBLP}) is exploited in this research, and the micro-level properties of the network formed in the {DBLP} co-authorship network are studied. Afterwards, the results are computed using social network measures and evaluated using the standard ranking performance evaluation measures, including Kendall correlation, Overlapping Similarlity ({OSim}) and Spearman rank-order correlation. The results reveal that the centrality measures are signiﬁcantly correlated with the citation count and h-index. Consequently, social network measures have potential to be used in an academic network to rank the authors.},
