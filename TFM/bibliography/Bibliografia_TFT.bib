abstract="The United Kingdom has been generally identified as a leader in the development of anti-racist legislation. Specific anti-racist legislation was first introduced in the 1960s, and developed further in the 1970s, following on from the large-scale post-war immigration from the Commonwealth which led to a large-scale non-white presence in the United Kingdom for the first time. Thus in response to the domestic social and political effects of this migration, the United Kingdom witnessed the development of anti-racist movements and of advanced legislation against racial discrimination at a much earlier stage than in most other European states. As well as tackling direct and indirect forms of discrimination, many anti-racist associations in the United Kingdom have been motivated by the need to confront directly movements of the extreme right or to tackle outbreaks in racist violence. However, political and cultural divisions persist within the national movement.",
