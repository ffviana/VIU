We compare two wellknown concepts for community detection that are implemented as distance functions in the algorithms {SCAN} [1] and {DENGRAPH} [2], the structural similarity of nodes and the number of interactions between nodes, respectively, in order to evaluate advantages and limitations of these approaches. Additionally, we propose to use a hierarchical approach for clustering in order to get rid of the problem of choosing an appropriate density threshold for community detection, a severe limitation of the applicability and usefulness of the {SCAN} and {DENGRAPH} algorithms in real life applications. We conduct all experiments on data sets with different characteristics, particularly Twitter data and Enron data.},

	abstract = {The characteristics of the host contact network over which a pathogen is transmitted affect both epidemic spread and the projected effectiveness of control strategies. Given the importance of understanding these contact networks, it is unfortunate that they are very difficult to measure directly. This challenge has led to an interest in methods to infer information about host contact networks from pathogen phylogenies, because in shaping a pathogen’s opportunities for reproduction, contact networks also shape pathogen evolution. Host networks influence pathogen phylogenies both directly, through governing opportunities for evolution, and indirectly by changing the prevalence and incidence. Here, we aim to separate these two effects by comparing pathogen evolution on different host networks that share similar epidemic trajectories. This approach allows use to examine the direct effects of network structure on pathogen phylogenies, largely controlling for confounding differences arising from population dynamics. We find that networks with more heterogeneous degree distributions yield pathogen phylogenies with more variable cluster numbers, smaller mean cluster sizes, shorter mean branch lengths, and somewhat higher tree imbalance than networks with relatively homogeneous degree distributions. However, in particular for dynamic networks, we find that these direct effects are relatively modest. These findings suggest that the role of the epidemic trajectory, the dynamics of the network and the inherent variability of metrics such as cluster size must each be taken into account when trying to use pathogen phylogenies to understand characteristics about the underlying host contact network.},

	abstract = {Background. Many studies of sexual behavior have shown that individuals vary greatly in their number of sexual partners over time, but it has proved difﬁcult to obtain parameter estimates relating to the dynamics of human immunodeﬁciency virus ({HIV}) transmission except in small-scale contact tracing studies. Recent developments in molecular phylodynamics have provided new routes to obtain these parameter estimates, and current clinical practice provides suitable data for entire infected populations.
Methods. A phylodynamic analysis was performed on partial pol gene sequences obtained for routine clinical care from 14 560 individuals, representing approximately 60\% of the {HIV}-positive men who have sex with men ({MSM}) under care in the United Kingdom.
Results. Among individuals linked to others in the data set, 29\% are linked to only 1 individual, 41\% are linked to 2–10 individuals, and 29\% are linked to \$10 individuals. The right-skewed degree distribution can be approximated by a power law, but the data are best ﬁtted by a Waring distribution for all time depths. For time depths of 5–7 years, the distribution parameter q lies within the range that indicates inﬁnite variance.
Conclusions. The transmission network among {UK} {MSM} is characterized by preferential association such that a randomly distributed intervention would not be expected to stop the epidemic.},

	abstract = {Phylogenies of highly genetically variable viruses such as {HIV}-1 are potentially informative of epidemiological dynamics. Several studies have demonstrated the presence of clusters of highly related {HIV}-1 sequences, particularly among recently {HIV}-infected individuals, which have been used to argue for a high transmission rate during acute infection. Using a large set of {HIV}-1 subtype B pol sequences collected from men who have sex with men, we demonstrate that virus from recent infections tend to be phylogenetically clustered at a greater rate than virus from patients with chronic infection (‘excess clustering’) and also tend to cluster with other recent {HIV} infections rather than chronic, established infections (‘excess coclustering’), consistent with previous reports. To determine the role that a higher infectivity during acute infection may play in excess clustering and co-clustering, we developed a simple model of {HIV} infection that incorporates an early period of intensified transmission, and explicitly considers the dynamics of phylogenetic clusters alongside the dynamics of acute and chronic infected cases. We explored the potential for clustering statistics to be used for inference of acute stage transmission rates and found that no single statistic explains very much variance in parameters controlling acute stage transmission rates. We demonstrate that high transmission rates during the acute stage is not the main cause of excess clustering of virus from patients with early/acute infection compared to chronic infection, which may simply reflect the shorter time since transmission in acute infection. Higher transmission during acute infection can result in excess coclustering of sequences, while the extent of clustering observed is most sensitive to the fraction of infections sampled.},

	abstract = {Clustering of social networks is an important task for their analysis; however, most existing algorithms do not scale to the massive size of today’s social networks. A popular class of graph clustering algorithms for large-scale networks, such as {PMetis}, {KMetis} and Graclus, is based on a multilevel framework. Generally, these multilevel algorithms work reasonably well on networks with a few million vertices. However, when the network size increases to the scale of 10 million vertices or greater, the performance of these algorithms rapidly degrades. Furthermore, an inherent property of social networks, the power law degree distribution, makes these algorithms infeasible to apply to large-scale social networks. In this paper, we propose a scalable and memory-efﬁcient clustering algorithm for large-scale social networks. We name our algorithm {GEM}, by mixing two key concepts of the algorithm, Graph Extraction and weighted kernel k-Means. {GEM} efﬁciently extracts a good skeleton graph from the original graph, and propagates the clustering result of the extracted graph to the rest of the network. Experimental results show that {GEM} produces clusters of quality comparable to or better than existing state-of-the-art graph clustering algorithms, while it is much faster and consumes much less memory. Furthermore, the parallel implementation of {GEM}, called {PGEM}, not only produces higher quality of clusters but also achieves much better scalability than most current parallel graph clustering algorithms.},

	abstract = {A social network often has numerous interesting attributes. When an attribute is quantiﬁed, a social tomography would arise from the underlying social network. One of the most interesting attributes is crime hotspots, whose existence has been strongly supported by observations that serious crimes ranging from residential burglary to homicide are strongly patterned in time and space, and by mathematical modeling. So far, however, the structures of hotspots, including their size distributions, have not been adequately studied. Here, we focus on a special type of hotspots, the sex offender clusters, in the United States, and show that their size distribution, where size is deﬁned as the ratio between sex offender population and total population in a 5-digit zip code area, follows a power-law distribution. In contrast, such local total population, both general and sex offenders, do not quite follow power-laws. A heavy-tailed power-law distribution is fundamentally different from a thin-tailed distribution such as a Poisson distribution, and can be used as an objective criterion for deﬁning sex offender clusters. More fundamentally, a power-law is a deﬁning property of self-similarity or fractal behavior. Therefore, our ﬁnding indicates that sex offender clusters, size-wise, self-organize into a fractal, due to interplay of economic conditions of offenders, policies and public perceptions.},

Hence, numerous research topics with respect to movement data have been undertaken. Yet, the research of dynamic interactions in movement data is still in its infancy. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach combining the multi-temporal scale spatio-temporal network ({MTSSTN}) and the continuous triangular model ({CTM}) for exploring dynamic interactions in movement data. The approach mainly includes four steps: ﬁrst, the relative trajectory calculus ({RTC}) is used to derive three types of interaction patterns; second, for each interaction pattern, a corresponding {MTSSTN} is generated; third, for each {MTSSTN}, the interaction intensity measures and three centrality measures (i.e., degree, betweenness and closeness) are calculated; ﬁnally, the results are visualized at multiple temporal scales using the {CTM} and analyzed based on the generated {CTM} diagrams. Based on the proposed approach, three distinctive aims can be achieved for each interaction pattern at multiple temporal scales: (1) exploring the interaction intensities between any two individuals; (2) exploring the interaction intensities among multiple individuals, and (3) exploring the importance of each individual and identifying the most important individuals. The movement data obtained from a real football match are used as a case study to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach is useful in exploring dynamic interactions in football movement data and discovering insightful information.},

              1.
               Network analysis is widely used in diverse fields and can be a powerful framework for studying the structure of biological systems. Temporal dynamics are a key issue for many ecological and evolutionary questions. These dynamics include both changes in network topology and flow on the network. Network analyses that ignore or do not adequately account for the temporal dynamics can result in inappropriate inferences.
            
            
              2.
               We suggest that existing methods are currently under‐utilized in many ecological and evolutionary network analyses and that the broader incorporation of these methods will considerably advance the current field. Our goal is to introduce ecologists and evolutionary biologists interested in studying network dynamics to extant ideas and methodological approaches, at a level appropriate for those new to the field.
            
            
              3.
               We present an overview of time‐ordered networks, which provide a framework for analysing network dynamics that addresses multiple inferential issues and permits novel types of temporally informed network analyses. We review available methods and software, discuss the utility and considerations of different approaches, provide a worked example analysis and highlight new research opportunities in ecology and evolutionary biology.

              Networks are often characterized by clusters of constituents that interact more closely with each other and have more connections to one another than they do with the rest of the components of the network. However, systematically identifying and studying such community structure in complicated networks is not easy, especially when the network interactions change over time or contain multiple types of connections, as seen in many biological regulatory networks or social networks.

            Network science is an interdisciplinary endeavor, with methods and applications drawn from across the natural, social, and information sciences. A prominent problem in network science is the algorithmic detection of tightly connected groups of nodes known as communities. We developed a generalized framework of network quality functions that allowed us to study the community structure of arbitrary multislice networks, which are combinations of individual networks coupled through links that connect each node in one network slice to itself in other slices. This framework allows studies of community structure in a general setting encompassing networks that evolve over time, have multiple types of links (multiplexity), and have multiple scales.},

	abstract = {Though sociologists have been interested in how temporal patterns of sociability vary in urban contexts, the study of city-level dynamics at short timescales has been challenging historically. Social media and new computational methods provide a solution. Our study clusters cities using sociality as a metric. We collected three months of social media data to investigate variation in the temporal structure of sociability across American cities. We find that cities cluster into three distinct types (‘Coastal’, ‘Transitional’ and ‘Heartland’) and that geographic proximity together with race, education and language associate with this clustering. Specifically, we found that clusters of Blacker cities tend to tweet more per capita, but also that more highly educated cities tend to tweet less per capita. These findings provide evidence that social media may be facilitating new opportunities to empower traditionally marginalized urban groups, a conclusion relevant to \#{BlackLivesMatter}, the George Floyd protests and other social movements.},

Most studies have focused on static networks, and in doing so, have neglected the temporal dynamics of the networks and communities. This paper considers the problem of tracking communities over time in dynamic social networks. We propose a method for community tracking using an adaptive evolutionary clustering framework. We apply the method to reveal the temporal evolution of communities in two real data sets. In addition, we obtain a statistic that can be used for identifying change points in the network.},

	abstract = {Social Complex Networks in communication networks are pivotal for comprehending the impact of human-like interactions on information ﬂow and communication efﬁciency. These networks replicate social behavior patterns in the digital realm by modeling device interactions, considering friendship, inﬂuence, and information-sharing frequency. A key challenge in communication networks is their dynamic topologies, driven by dynamic user behaviors, ﬂuctuating trafﬁc patterns, and scalability needs. Analyzing these changes is essential for optimizing routing and enhancing the user experience. This paper introduces a network model tailored for Opportunistic Networks, characterized by intermittent device connections and disconnections, resulting in sporadic connectivity. The model analyzes node behavior, extracts vital properties, and ranks nodes by inﬂuence. Furthermore, it explores the evolution of node connections over time, gaining insights into changing roles and their impact on data exchange. Real-world datasets validate the model’s effectiveness. Applying it enables the development of reﬁned routing protocols based on dynamic inﬂuence rankings. This approach fosters more efﬁcient, adaptive communication systems that dynamically respond to evolving network conditions and user behaviors.},

This study applied a social networks approach to examine patterns of information flow within the \#{FreeAJStaff} movement on Twitter: the emergence of information siloes and social mediators, who bridge them. Twitter data of 22 months were collected, resulting in social networks created by 71,326 users who included the hashtag \#{FreeAJStaff} in their tweets, and 149,650 social ties (mentions and replies) among them. Analysis found social mediators to be primarily core movement actors (e.g., Al Jazeera) or elites (e.g., politicians), rather than grassroots actors. Furthermore, core actors exhibited more reciprocal relationship with other users than elite actors. In contrast, elite actors evoked denser exchange of messages. Finally, this study identified the mechanism used to create a Spillover Effect between social movements (such as \#{FreeAJStaff} and \#{FreeShawkan}), finding that mediated content, which travels across clusters, was more likely to include non-{FreeAJStaff} movement hashtags, than siloed content, which remains within a cluster. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

One exciting finding since the advent of brain network research was that the brain network can withstand extensive damage, even to highly connected regions. However, these highly connected nodes may not be the most critical regions of the brain network, and it is unclear how the network dynamics are impacted by removal of these key nodes. This work seeks to further investigate the resilience of the human functional brain network. Network attack experiments were conducted on voxel-wise functional brain networks and region-of-interest ({ROI}) networks of 5 healthy volunteers. Networks were attacked at key nodes using several criteria for assessing node importance, and the impact on network structure and dynamics was evaluated. The findings presented here echo previous findings that the functional human brain network is highly resilient to targeted attacks, both in terms of network structure and dynamics.},

	abstract = {A perspective is taken on the intangible complexity of economic and social systems by investigating the dynamical processes producing, storing and transmitting information in ﬁnancial time series. An extensive analysis based on the moving average cluster entropy approach has evidenced market and horizon dependence in highest-frequency data of real world ﬁnancial assets. The behavior is scrutinized by applying the moving average cluster entropy approach to long-range correlated stochastic processes as the Autoregressive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average ({ARFIMA}) and Fractional Brownian motion ({FBM}). An extensive set of series is generated with a broad range of values of the Hurst exponent H and of the autoregressive, differencing and moving average parameters p, d, q. A systematic relation between moving average cluster entropy and long-range correlation parameters H, d is observed. This study shows that the characteristic behaviour exhibited by the horizon dependence of the cluster entropy is related to long-range positive correlation in ﬁnancial markets. Speciﬁcally, long range positively correlated {ARFIMA} processes with differencing parameter d 0.05, d 0.15 and d 0.25 are consistent with moving average cluster entropy results obtained in time series of {DJIA}, S\&P500 and {NASDAQ}. The ﬁndings clearly point to a variability of price returns, consistently with a price dynamics involving multiple temporal scales and, thus, shortand long-run volatility components. An important aspect of the proposed approach is the ability to capture detailed horizon dependence over relatively short horizons (one to twelve months) and thus its relevance to deﬁne risk analysis indices.},

However, nowadays, most types of networks are dynamic, meaning their topology changes over time. The connection weights and the strengths of social links between nodes are an important concept in a social network. The new centrality measures are proposed for weighted networks, which relies on a time-ordered weighted graph model, generalized temporal degree and closeness centrality. Furthermore, two measures—Temporal {DegreeDegree} and Temporal Closeness-Closeness—are employed to better understand the signiﬁcance of nodes in weighted dynamic networks. Our study is caried out according to real dynamic weighted networks dataset of a university-based karate club. Through extensive experiments and discussions of the proposed metrics, our analysis proves that there is an effectiveness on the impact of each node throughout social networks.},
