	abstract = {In online social media systems users are not only posting, consuming, and sharing content, but also creating new and destroying existing connections in the underlying social network. This behavior lead us to investigate how user structural position reacts with the evolution of the underlying social network structure. While centrality metrics have been studied in the past, much less is known about their temporal behaviors and processing, mainly when analyzing not just networks snapshots, but interval graphs. Here, we study Twitter follower/followee network and how users centralities evolve over time. Our analysis is founded on temporal graphs theory. First, we model Twitter as a temporal network and revisit the concept of shortest path considering the time dimension. We show how to compute closeness and betweenness centralities using fastest paths. Then, we propose a baseline algorithm for mining streams of temporal networks. The task is to ﬁnd all pairs fastest paths inside an observation window. We ﬁnd that Twitter users are fairly dynamic and from one moment to the next, they can assume (or leave) central roles in the network.},

	title = {Time-Varying Graphs and Social Network Analysis: Temporal Indicators and Metrics},
	abstract = {Most instruments - formalisms, concepts, and metrics for social networks analysis fail to capture their dynamics. Typical systems exhibit different scales of dynamics, ranging from the ﬁne-grain dynamics of interactions (which recently led researchers to consider temporal versions of distance, connectivity, and related indicators), to the evolution of network properties over longer periods of time. This paper proposes a general formal approach to study networks’ structural evolution for both atemporal and temporal indicators, based respectively on sequences of static graphs and sequences of time-varying graphs that cover successive time-windows. All the concepts and indicators, some of which are new, are expressed using a time-varying graph formalism recently proposed in [10]. Experimental results of the application of atemporal metrics applied to a portion of the scientiﬁc community of {arXiv} are provided.},

	abstract = {Many temporal networks exhibit multiple system states, such as weekday and weekend patterns in social contact networks. The detection of such distinct states in temporal network data has recently been studied as it helps reveal underlying dynamical processes. A commonly used method is network aggregation over a time window, which aggregates a subsequence of multiple network snapshots into one static network. This method, however, necessarily discards temporal dynamics within the time window. Here we propose a new method for detecting dynamic states in temporal networks using connection series (i.e., time series of connection status) between nodes. Our method consists of the construction of connection series tensors over nonoverlapping time windows, similarity measurement between these tensors, and community detection in the similarity network of those time windows. Experiments with empirical temporal network data demonstrated that our method outperformed the conventional approach using simple network aggregation in revealing interpretable system states. In addition, our method allows users to analyze hierarchical temporal structures and to uncover dynamic states at different spatial/temporal resolutions.},

	abstract = {The problem of temporal community detection is discussed in this paper. Main existing methods are either structure-based or incremental analysis. The difﬁculty of the former is to select a suitable time window. The latter needs to know the initial structure of networks and the changing of networks should be stable. For most real data sets, these conditions hardly prevail. A streaming method called Temporal Label Walk ({TLW}) is proposed in this paper, where the aforementioned restrictions are eliminated. Modularity of the snapshots is used to evaluate our method. Experiments reveal the effectiveness of {TLW} on temporal community detection. Compared with other static methods in real data sets, our method keeps a higher modularity with the increase of window size.},

In order to support the needs of speciﬁc applications, as well as general tasks related to data curation, cleaning, linking, post-processing, and data analysis, data models and data stores are needed that aﬀord eﬃcient and scalable querying of the data. In particular, it is important to design solutions that allow rich queries that simultaneously involve the topology of the social network, temporal information on the presence and interactions of individual nodes, and node metadata. Here we introduce a data model for time-varying social network data that can be represented as a property graph in the Neo4j graph database. We use time-varying social network data collected by using wearable sensors and study the performance of real-world queries, pointing to strengths, weaknesses and challenges of the proposed approach.},
